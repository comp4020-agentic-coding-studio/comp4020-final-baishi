# syntax = docker/dockerfile:1

# Node version pinned to match mise.toml. better-sqlite3@13 ships a
# prebuilt N-API binary for linux-x64 directly in the package (no
# node-gyp, no prebuild-install network fetch, no install/postinstall
# script at all — confirmed by inspecting the installed package) and
# N-API is ABI-stable across Node versions, so there's no native
# toolchain this image ever needs.
